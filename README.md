# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It allows you to study anywhere on anything as well as containing a function to help you decide on what to study if the user has access to the console. I built this project as a fun way to utilize what im learning in a way that also lets me go back and review what i've learned after.

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should appear below or to the side of page in the browser. There you will see the list of topics we learned in the Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
